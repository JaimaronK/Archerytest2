Archery Test without the Device Simulator
This is the version that can only be used with VR headsets and controllers. Just like the version that has the simulator this one has not been tested with VR or tested fully to see if pulling on the bowstring works. However I can confirm that hitting targets will increase the score and shooting too close will create a text pop up if a target is hit and will also not increase the score.
